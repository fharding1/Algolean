# Brute force discrete logarithm in a generic group

In this file we state and prove the correctness and complexity of the generic brute force
discrete logarithm algorithm in the model of `Algolean.Models.GenericGroup`. Given a generator
`g`, a target `h` and the order of the group, the algorithm walks through the multiples
`1 • g, 2 • g, …, order • g` of `g`, comparing each one against `h`, and returns the first
exponent that matches.

The algorithm is a `GroupAlg 2 ℕ`, so it is polymorphic in the type of group elements and the
group appears only in the statements below, through the instances that `GroupProg.eval` and
`GroupProg.cost` are read against; see `Algolean.Models.GenericGroup` for what that quantification
buys.

Note that the search starts at the exponent `1` rather than `0`: the identity element is not the
target of interest, and in a group of order `order` it is `order • g` anyway, so no group element
is missed.

## Main definitions

- `dlogInputs`: The inputs of a discrete-logarithm instance, the base point and the target.
- `bruteForceDLogAux`: The main loop of the algorithm, searching from a given accumulator.
- `bruteForceDLog`: Brute force discrete logarithm as a generic group algorithm.

## Main results

- `bruteForceDLog_eval`: the algorithm returns `k` whenever `k` is the least positive exponent
  with `k • g = h`, provided the order it was given is at least `k`.
- `bruteForceDLog_eval_nsmul`: **run in any finite group at its own order, brute force solves the
  discrete logarithm.** This is the form the lower bound of `Algolean.LowerBounds.DiscreteLog`
  asks for, and it is what keeps that bound from being vacuous.
- `bruteForceDLog_eval_zmod`: in *any* group of prime order `p`, on *any* base `g ≠ 0`, the
  exponent read back in `ZMod p` is the secret itself and not merely some exponent that hits the
  same element — the discrete logarithm is unique there, and brute force finds that one.
- `bruteForceDLog_cost_le`: the algorithm always performs at most `order` additions and `order`
  equality tests.

## In a finite group

The order of the group is what bounds the search, so brute force is correct exactly when the order
it is handed is honest. In a finite group every multiple of `g` is a multiple with a *positive*
exponent bounded by the order of the group, which is what the search needs, and this is the form
in which the lower bound of `Algolean.LowerBounds.DiscreteLog` asks for correctness.

## In a group of prime order

`bruteForceDLog_eval_nsmul` pins the answer down only up to the base: it says the exponent that
comes back is *a* discrete logarithm of the target, not that it is the exponent the target was
built from. Once the base generates, the two coincide, because the exponents hitting a given
element are then a single residue class modulo the order of the group. Reading the answer back in
`ZMod p` therefore returns the secret that was handed in — the secret `0` included, on which the
search itself returns `p` rather than `0`.

A group of prime order is the case of interest, since there every base other than `0` generates.
The group is arbitrary: any `G` with `Fintype.card G = p`, and any nonzero `g` in it. Such a `G`
is of course isomorphic to `ZMod p`, where discrete logarithms are no work at all, but that costs
these statements nothing, since `bruteForceDLog` is a `GroupAlg` and never sees the isomorphism.
All it can do with the labels it is handed is add them and compare them, and it is charged for
both, so it pays the same price in every group of order `p`.

**Brute force returns the exponent it was given, modulo the order, whenever the base generates.**
The hypothesis `addOrderOf g = p` is what removes the slack in `bruteForceDLog_eval_nsmul`: the
exponents `k` with `k • g = x • g` are exactly those congruent to `x` modulo `p`, so an answer
read back in `ZMod p` can only be `x` itself.

**Brute force recovers every secret exactly in a group of prime order.** The algorithm is the same
one as before, run on an arbitrary group `G` of prime order `p` and an arbitrary base `g ≠ 0`, and
only its answer is read back in `ZMod p`. The conclusion is an equality of exponents rather than
the equality of group elements of `bruteForceDLog_eval_nsmul`: what comes back is not merely some
discrete logarithm of the target, it is the unique one, the secret `x` itself. This is also what
makes it right on the secret `0`, where the search returns `p`.
